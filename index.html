<h3>Personal Weaponery</h3>
<p>The Iron Man armor, as well as providing superhuman strength and phisycal protection for Tony Stark, also contains jetboots that allow him to fly, and a variety of weapons including repulsor rays, pulse beams, missile launchers, lasers, tasers, and flamethrowers. The unibeam in the center of his chest can emit various types of light energy, and his helmet contains communication devises (including FM radio), scanning equipment, and recording devises.</p>

<p>Tapping into external power sources can increase the capabilities of the Iron Man armor.

Special suits of Iron Man armor include those designed for use underwater and in outer space, and a suit of stealth armor that is immune to radar, but affords little physical protection, and has only minimal weapons.</p>
